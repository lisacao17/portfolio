        <h3>Intro</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="body-content">
        <p>Google Play was my first internship at Google where I had the amazing opportunity to learn from the MOB UX team. I didn't even expect to pass the first round of interviews 🙈 but I’m very grateful for this to have been the start of my Google journey.</p>

          <h2>How might we clearly communicate why an app is missing in the Play Store and provide useful exits?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Before this project, a significant percentage of searches on Google Play resulted in unavailable apps. There are a number of reasons for its unavailability but overall there was no clear messaging or helpful alternatives provided. These factors resulted in spam apps frequently downloaded and an unpleasant user experience.</p>
       <br>
        <div class="solution-banner-stacked">
          <p>Solution ✅</p>
          <h2>A scalable error banner and a helpful suggested apps ribbon</h2>
        </div>
        <img src="images/google-play/before-vs-after.jpg" alt="" id="round">
        <br><br>
        <p>As you can see, the previous design on the left was a plain list of results based off of the string in the search query. This results in low quality apps showing up and is not helpful for users looking for something in particular.</p>
        <p>The new redesign on the right now includes a brief message explaining the error and recommends high quality alternatives based on the app type in a ribbon below. This ensures suggested apps are quality alternatives and provides a helpful exit path.</p>
        <p id="bullet">Reduced user confusion 📉</p>
        <p id="bullet-line">Post-launch, user refinement and query re-issue was shown to be reduced by <span id="bold">30%</span>. For example, if someone saw our error message, they wouldn’t have to re-search because they understood the unavailability properly.</p>
        <p id="bullet">Reduced installs of low quality apps 📉</p>
        <p id="bullet-line">14 day regretted installs was also reduced by <span id="bold">10%</span> while the percentage of successful installs rose by <span id="bold">2%,</span> showing that our suggested alternatives proved to be helpful.</p>

          <p>Project Goal 📈</p>
          <h2>How might we create a filtering feature on Google Search for people to find their desired apps faster and more efficiently?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Our team also works on a module on Google Search for displaying app results but it previously only displayed plain lists with limited capabilities. This project was to design a new filtering feature to help users narrow down their options and find their desired app faster.</p>
       <br>
        <div class="solution-banner-stacked">
          <p>Solution ✅</p>
          <h2>A simple filter chip design to sort for top rated, new, and featured apps</h2>
        </div>
        <img src="images/google-play/filter-flow.jpg" alt="" id="round">
        <br><br>
        <p>Working together with our cross functional team, we landed on these three filters (top rated, new, and featured apps on Play/App Store) that appear sticky at the top of our immersive view.</p>
        <p id="bullet">Reduced the need to search a new query 📉</p>
        <p id="bullet-line">In an A/B test, our new filter design helped reduce query re-issues by <span id="bold">1.28%.</span> This percentage may seem small but was actually quite significant for Search that typically works in the decimals and led to the launch of this project!</p>

      <div class="body-content">
        <p>I definitely felt some imposter syndrome in the beginning but thanks to the help of my amazing hosts, I was able to learn so much and launch two successful features within one summer.
