      <div class="body-content">
        <p>Building on top of my experience last summer, I was able to join a new team and product area this summer with Stadia! Stadia is Googleâ€™s gaming platform that allows people to stream games with any compatible device using cloud technology. My team in particular, the DevUX team, worked on building the tools our game developers and studios use!</p>
        <p>My role this summer was to redesign some of our key components to Google Material 2 and adapt them to suit all of our use cases. If youâ€™re interested in learning more, feel free to reach out and Iâ€™d be super excited to show you my project deck :)</p>

        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="body-content">
        <h6>1. How to help build design systems</h6>
        <p>Before this summer, design systems used to be really intimidating to me. There were so many moving parts and using Figma components was super confusing to me. Iâ€™m so glad that my hosts challenged me with my projects though because now I think I can confidently tackle any other design system or component. Iâ€™ve learned how to consider all the use cases and states, how to follow Material Design, and how to take leverage all of Figmaâ€™s capabilities.</p>
        <h6>2. How to adapt to different Eng constraints</h6>
        <p>For my project this summer, there were a variety of Eng constraints that we had to design around. With the help of my hosts, I got to learn how to navigate those obstacles and turn them into design opportunities. It was tricky to balance our userâ€™s needs with Eng constraints but Iâ€™m happy that I got to learn this crucial skill!</p>
        <h6>3. How to navigate in-office work life</h6>
        <p>This summer was also my first time working in person since my first internship in 2019! I was so excited to finally experience office life and in-person collaboration. Iâ€™ve gained a lot of soft skills and made some new friends along the way : )</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="body-content">
        <p>In conclusion, this summer was definitely one of the most memorable internships in my design journey so far.  I got to work on new visual design skills and grow as a better team player overall.
